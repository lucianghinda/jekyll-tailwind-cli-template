# Install project
- install ruby version manager of any kind (I use rvm, but asdf or anything like that will work too)
- install latest ruby version (3.3.0 as example)
- run `gem install bundler`, bundler would manage dependencies in a project
- run `bundle install`, this would install all dependencies in project
- run `jekyll serve` and go to `localhost:4000`

During development, you need to run `jekyll serve --watch` to see changes in real time (hot-reload).
