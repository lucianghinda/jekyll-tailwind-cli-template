## jekyll-tailwind-cli-template
Template repository for Jekyll powered website that integrates with Tailwind CSS.

All other templates or manuals suggest to install javascript bundlers, but I don't really see any reason for that. This template uses Tailwind CLI instead. This is quite streight forward thanks to prior work in [jekyll-tailwind gem](https://github.com/crbelaus/jekyll-tailwind).

Still wanted something where I can start immediately writting html and tailwind code. So here it is!

## Setup
1. `bundle install`
2. `jekyll s --watch`
